This dataset was collected at the University of Wisconsin Clinical Sciences Center (1991-1995) by Dr. William Wolberg and colleagues.\n\n**Clinical Procedure: Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA)**\n- FNA is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure using a thin needle (23-25 gauge) to sample cells from a suspicious breast lesion\n- Cells are prepared on glass slides and visualized under microscopy\n- Cytopathologists manually outline cell nuclei and measure ~30 morphological features\n- This approach bridges between clinical urgency (rapid diagnosis) and accuracy\n\n**The Features: From Microscopy to Data**\nThe dataset includes **30 continuous features** derived from digitized images of FNA slides, organized in three groups:\n\n| Group | Features | Biological Meaning |\n|-------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Standard statistics (10)** | radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension | Single value per nucleus |\n| **Mean values (10)** | Mean of each standard feature across the nucleus | Aggregate nuclear characteristics |\n| **Standard error (10)** | SE of each standard feature | Variability within the nucleus |\n\n**Target Variable: Diagnosis**\n- **M (Malignant)**: Cancerous nuclei (212 cases)\n- **B (Benign)**: Non-cancerous nuclei (357 cases)\n- Binary classification problem",

This dataset was collected at the University of Wisconsin Clinical Sciences Center (1991-1995) by Dr. William Wolberg and colleagues.\\n\\n**Clinical Procedure: Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA)**\\n- FNA is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure using a thin needle (23-25 gauge) to sample cells from a suspicious breast lesion\\n- Cells are prepared on glass slides and visualized under microscopy\\n- Cytopathologists manually outline cell nuclei and measure ~30 morphological features\\n- This approach bridges between clinical urgency (rapid diagnosis) and accuracy\\n\\n**The Features: From Microscopy to Data**\\nThe dataset includes **30 continuous features** derived from digitized images of FNA slides, organized in three groups:\\n\\n| Group | Features | Biological Meaning |\\n|-------|----------|-------------------|\\n| **Standard statistics (10)** | radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension | Single value per nucleus |\\n| **Mean values (10)** | Mean of each standard feature across the nucleus | Aggregate nuclear characteristics |\\n| **Standard error (10)** | SE of each standard feature | Variability within the nucleus |\\n\\n**Target Variable: Diagnosis**\\n- **M (Malignant)**: Cancerous nuclei (212 cases)\\n- **B (Benign)**: Non-cancerous nuclei (357 cases)\\n- Binary classification problem\"}",

Which feature pairs are most highly correlated?\n2. Are certain measurement groups (e.g., \"radius\" variants) more correlated with each other?\n3. What % of feature variance can be explained by just a few principal components?",

(False positives increase anxiety)\n- **AUC-ROC:** Overall discriminative ability (0.5 = random, 1.0 = perfect)\n\n**Clinical Context:**\n- Missing a cancer (low sensitivity) → patient harm\n- False alarm (low specificity) → unnecessary procedures, anxiety\n- Real clinical systems require balance based on disease prevalence & consequences\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Which model has best sensitivity (catches cancers)?\n2. Which has best specificity (avoids false alarms)?\n3. Is there a trade-off between sensitivity/specificity?\n4.

Now, let's ask: **What if we ignore diagnosis labels and let the data itself reveal structure?**\n\nPCA answers: \"What directions in feature space explain the most variance?\"\n\n**Biological Question:**\nDo the major patterns in nuclear morphology align with benign/malignant distinction, or is there other clinically important variation? \n- If yes → diagnosis follows naturally from morphology\n- If no → other factors (patient age, tumor location, genetics?) may matter\n\n**Your Tasks:**\n1. How many principal components explain 90% of variance?\n2. Do the first 2-3 PCs separate malignant from benign?\n3. Are there distinct subgroups within malignant tumors suggesting heterogeneity?",

If subtypes exist:\n1. What morphological features distinguish them?\n2. Do these subtypes show different model predictions (are some \"easier\" to diagnose than others)?\n3. Could this explain why some breast cancers are more aggressive?\n\n**Hypothesis:** High-grade tumors (aggressive, poor prognosis) likely show extreme morphologies, while low-grade tumors are more benign-like. Clustering might reveal this stratification.\n\n**Methods:** \n- K-means clustering on malignant cases\n- Analyze cluster characteristics\n- Relate to diagnostic difficulty",

ACCURACY = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)\\n   → Overall correctness. ⚠️ Misleading if classes imbalanced!\\n   → Range: 0-1 (1 = perfect)\\n   → Example: 96% of diagnoses are correct\\n\\n2. SENSITIVITY (True Positive Rate) = TP / (TP + FN)\\n   → Of all malignant cases, what % did we catch?\\n   → CRITICAL for cancer screening! Low = missed cancers = patient harm\\n   → Range: 0-1 (1 = no false negatives)\\n   → Example: Sensitivity 97% = 3% of cancers missed (dangerous!)\\n\\n3. SPECIFICITY (True Negative Rate) = TN / (TN + FP)\\n   → Of all benign cases, what % did we correctly call benign?\\n   → Important for reducing unnecessary procedures\\n   → Range: 0-1 (1 = no false positives)\\n   → Example: Specificity 95% = 5% false alarm rate\\n\\n4. PRECISION = TP / (TP + FP)\\n   → When model predicts MALIGNANT, how often is it correct?\\n   → Important for positive predictive value (confidence in positive diagnosis)\\n\\n5. F1-SCORE = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\\n   → Harmonic mean of precision and recall\\n   → Good for imbalanced datasets where you want balance between TP and FP\\n\\n6.

This dataset was collected at the University of Wisconsin Clinical Sciences Center (1991-1995) by Dr. William Wolberg and colleagues.\n\n**Clinical Procedure: Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA)**\n- FNA is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure using a thin needle (23-25 gauge) to sample cells from a suspicious breast lesion\n- Cells are prepared on glass slides and visualized under microscopy\n- Cytopathologists manually outline cell nuclei and measure ~30 morphological features\n- This approach bridges between clinical urgency (rapid diagnosis) and accuracy\n\n**The Features: From Microscopy to Data**\nThe dataset includes **30 continuous features** derived from digitized images of FNA slides, organized in three groups:\n\n| Group | Features | Biological Meaning |\n|-------|----------|-------------------|\n| **Standard statistics (10)** | radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension | Single value per nucleus |\n| **Mean values (10)** | Mean of each standard feature across the nucleus | Aggregate nuclear characteristics |\n| **Standard error (10)** | SE of each standard feature | Variability within the nucleus |\n\n**Target Variable: Diagnosis**\n- **M (Malignant)**: Cancerous nuclei (212 cases)\n- **B (Benign)**: Non-cancerous nuclei (357 cases)\n- Binary classification problem\n</VSCode.Cell>\n<VSCode.Cell id=\"#VSC-7c975d0a\" language=\"markdown\">\n### 1.2 Image Analysis Pipeline: From Microscopy to Quantification\n\n```\nMicroscopy Slide with FNA sample\n    ↓\nDigital Image Acquisition (CAS-200 instrument)\n    ↓\nImage Segmentation: Identify cell nuclei boundaries\n    ↓\nFeature Extraction: Measure 30 morphological properties per nucleus\n    ↓\nStatistical Analysis: Mean, standard error of measurements\n    ↓\nClinical Interpretation: M vs B classification\n```\n\n**Why These Features?**\nMalignant tumors typically show:\n- **Larger, more irregular nuclei** (↑ radius, ↑ perimeter, ↑ area)\n- **Increased nuclear complexity** (↑ concavity, ↑ concave points)\n- **Loss of uniformity** (↓ symmetry, ↑ texture variation)\n- **Abnormal texture patterns** (↑ compactness)\n</VSCode.Cell>\n<VSCode.Cell id=\"#VSC-75875a0f\" language=\"markdown\">\n---\n\n## Part II: Setting Up Your Environment\n\nTo run this exercise, you'll need:\n\n**Python packages:**\n```yaml\n# environment.yml -

Discovering Tumor Subtypes & Clinical Heterogeneity\n\n### 6.1 The Central Non-Obvious Biological Question\n\n**Question:** Are all malignant tumors morphologically identical, or do they form distinct subtypes with different characteristics?\n\n**Clinical Motivation:**\nWe know that breast cancer is not one disease, but rather **multiple subtypes** (ER+, HER2+, Triple-Negative, etc.) with different prognoses and treatments. \n\n**Your Challenge:**\nUse **unsupervised clustering** to discover whether the WDBC malignant group naturally separates into subtypes. If subtypes exist:\n1. What morphological features distinguish them?\n2. Do these subtypes show different model predictions (are some \"easier\" to diagnose than others)?\n3. Could this explain why some breast cancers are more aggressive?\n\n**Hypothesis:** High-grade tumors (aggressive, poor prognosis) likely show extreme morphologies, while low-grade tumors are more benign-like.
